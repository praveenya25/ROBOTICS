        Our first advanced robot was the T8 spider, for which we used 3D printing methods in a time when very few were using it for robotics. To control the robot, we developed an inverse kinematics engine that amused the world and for this achievement, we received a lot of positive reviews and coverage. After seeing how our T8 entertained the public, we decided to make a mass-produced version of it, the T8X, to make it more accessible for people.

Since then, weâ€™ve also been focusing on helping other organizations in their businesses wherever robotics applied.
